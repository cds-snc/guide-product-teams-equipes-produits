## Product team member responsibilities

**Purpose of this document:** Clarify who, _by default_, is responsible for key elements of building a product. Why? Because we often have subtly different understandings.

**These responsibilities are not exhaustive.** These responsibilities focus on your role as embedded on a product team. A team member may have broader responsibilities to their community, or the organization, that isn’t described here. There may be other important things to do to help your product succeed. We trust team members to do what needs to be done.

**If there are multiple team members from a community on a team, they share the responsibilities for their discipline.** For example, if there are multiple developers on a product, they divide up the responsibilities amongst themselves.

**Others can (and should) support other team’s responsibilities.** This document describes who’s ultimately accountable. It doesn’t limit who can be involved. Many responsibilities touch many members of a product team. 

### Responsibilities each discipline has for their respective expertise {#responsibilities-each-discipline-has-for-their-respective-expertise}

*   Documenting their activities, decisions and outputs for fellow and future team members and others in the government to learn from
*   Raising opportunities to tell compelling stories about their work to the Outreach team
*   Being able to demonstrate the working service, and explain the reasoning behind key product decisions.
*   _For partnership products:_ Coaching their “pair” from the partner on how to adapt their expertise to our way of working.
